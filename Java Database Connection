What is Database?
    The database is an organized collection of data.
MySQL Database?
    'My' - the name of the daughter of co-founder.
    SQL - Standard Query Language.
    
If you want to connect and practice database? (Extra)
    Work on the notepad, so you would remember the classes name that's all you need in the exam.
    Download the JDBC Driver - https://www.dropbox.com/s/p6ztza1eqos8x3j/SQL.rar?dl=0
    Copy the files from SQL folder, place it in your java folder where you installed it, in the bin folder.
	Copy the path to bin folder.
	Now open Advance System Settings -> Enviorment Variables ->
		add this
			ThePathYouCopied\mysql-connector-java-5.1.47-bin.jar
		to CLASSPATH
		if you don't have any CLASSPATH variable create and add this.
		Example: C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_191\bin\mysql-connector-java-5.1.47-bin.jar
	For MySQL Server
        Download WAMP.
        Run it.
        Learn how to use MySQL from PhpMyAdmin.
        
What to learn? (Only the basics)
    FX or Swing?
        None, database has nothing to do with FX or Swing. We will learn how to run a database using prints.
        
    Classes used:
        DriverManager        
        SQLException
        Connection
        Statement
        ResultSet
        
    To check if you have installed the driver properly. (Extra)
        Run this code
        
        import java.sql.*;  //This is used to import all the classes we need to establish a connection and use it. 
        public class DriverTest { //DriverTest is class name.

            static { //The Static Block
                try { //Try Block
                    Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
                } catch(Exception ex) { //Catching the exception
                    System.out.println("Unable to load MySQL Driver");
                    System.exit(0);//This will close the program if driver does not exsist.
                }
            }//Static block ends.
            public static void main(String args[]) { //The Main method, which runs in start.
                System.out.println("Java Driver Worked");
            }//Main method ends.
        }//Class ends.
        
        
    Setting up the connection: (According to Sir Shahbaz, your connection would already be established)
        Info required about of your database.
            Server port - Default (3306)
            Database name.
            Server Username - Default (root)
            Server Password - By Default, there is no password for root username.
        
        Classes used:
            Connection
            DriverManager
            SQLException
            
        Method: 
            getConnection(String url,String Username, String Password);
            
        Getting Started
            Create an object of class 'Connection'.
            Store connection in it.
                DriverManager.getConnection(); - This method returns the the Object of Connection class.    
            
        Code:
            import java.sql.*;  //This is used to import all the classes we need to establish a connection and use it. 
            public class ConnectionTest { //ConnectionTest is class name.
                public static void main(String args[]) {//The Main method, which runs in the start.
                    try {    //Try Block
                        Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/accounts","Arose","123");//Connection is class. accounts is my database name. 3306 is port. Arose is my username. 123 is my password. DriverManager will select the JDBC driver and call getConnection method from it.
                    }//End of try block
                    catch(SQLException e) //Catch Block
                    { System.out.println("Connection Failed");} 
                }//End of main method
            
            }//End of class
            
        Your connection is stored     
            
    Inserting Data into your table.
    
        Info required about of your database:
            Table name.
            Column names and type.
        
        Classes used:
            SQLException
            Connection
            Statement
        
        Method:
            createStatement();
            execute(String Query);
            excuteUpdate(String Query);
            getUpdateCount();
            
        Getting Started
            Suppose 
                we have already established a connection and stored it in our 'con' variable.
                String username stores username I need to store in my table.
                String password stores password I need to store in my table.
                My table name is Accounts.
                    Columns are Username and Password, both are of String type.
            Now create an object of Statement, i.e create a new statement.
                con.createStatement(); //This returns a Statement.
            Create a string with your query.
            Execute the query.
        
        Code 1:
            try {
                Statement stmt=con.createStatement();   //This will create our statement that we will be sent to database.
                String query = String.format("INSERT INTO Accounts (username,password) VALUES ('%s','%s')",username,password); //To Learn the SQL queries, i'll tell later in this tutorial, most likely sir might include the queries too.
                stmt.execute(query); //This will execute our query. Will send our data to the database.
                int rows =stmt.getUpdateCount(); //This returns the no of rows that were changed or inserted in the database. 
                if(rows > 0) //If the no of rows changed was greater than 0 than means our code worked.
                    System.out.println("Data has been stored");
                else 
                    System.out.println("Failed to store.");
            }
            catch(SQLException e) //Exception is thrown when, your access is to database is denied.
            {
                System.out.println("Error occured");
            }
        Code 2:
            try {
                Statement stmt=con.createStatement(); //Statement Created. 
                String query = "INSERT INTO Accounts (username,password) VALUES ('Arose Khan Niazi','ParhLoAbTu')";
                int rows = stmt.executeUpdate(query); //This will execute our query. Will send our data to the database. And return the no of rows that have been changed or updated.
                if(rows > 0) //If the no of rows changed was greater than 0 than means our code worked. Means that Arose Khan Niazi with password ParhLoAbTu has been updated to my Accounts table.
                    System.out.println("Data has been stored");
                else 
                    System.out.println("Failed to store.");
            }
            catch(SQLException e) //Exception is thrown when, your access is to database is denied.
            {
                System.out.println("Error occured");
            }
            
    Getting Data from your table.
